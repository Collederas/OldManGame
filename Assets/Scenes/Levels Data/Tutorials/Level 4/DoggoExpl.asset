  sentences:
  - They are not really dangerous per se but if they see you they will chase you
    till the end of time.
  - You're quite feeble so they will push you all over the place!
  - Luckily they are quite stupid and would follow you litterelly to their own death.
  - Ideally you should get rid of them, no matter how.
  - ' If you really can''t, then try to distance them circling around some obstacle.'
  - If you disappear from their sight long enough they will eventually let go.
