  - Careful!
  - There's a big hole on the way.
  - It's so big you could easily fall into it and hurt yourself pretty bad!
  - I'm sure this park has more, considering the lazy administration of this city...
  - But seems we're in luck. Look at that blue pill!
  - If it is what I think it is, it will grant you some extra energy.
  - Go and pick it up!
