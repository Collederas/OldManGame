  - YES! Can you feel the energy flowing through your old decrepit body?
  - Collecting pills will give you a limited amount of boosts.
  - A boost allows you to temporarily sprint in the direciton you are walking in.
  - And should be enough to allow you to pass over narrow gaps like the one ahead.
  - Give it a try!
  - Walk towards the hole and, right before the edge, press SPACEBAR to boost.
  - Good luck! See you on the other side.
  - ... if you can make it.
