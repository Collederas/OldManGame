# OldManGame

I was given one concept to develop a game in a month: old man.
Here you can find the latest results of the challenge.

Note:
The starting day was 02/12/2020.

Version 0.1.0 is the result of the challenge. I am currently continuing the project to improve what I rushed and learn from it.
